# Difference-in-difference analysis

We perform difference-in-difference analysis to find out if using paid search ads (brandkeywords) has a significant effect on log(Total). The log is chosen to make the results of Bing and Google more comparable.

Two independent variables:
Time: before and after treatment (treatment: turn brandkeywords off)
Origin: treatment group and control group (treatment = Google, control = Bing)

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(log(Total) ~ Time*Origin, data = Data)
summary(mod1)
```

Time1:OriginGoogle coefficient is not significant. Zero hypothesis that the usage of brandkeywords has no effect on dependent variable cannot be rejected.

# Conclusion

The conducted difference-in-difference analysis confirms the statistically insignificant effect of paid search ads. Therefore, we recommend to stop spending money for brand keyword ads.
